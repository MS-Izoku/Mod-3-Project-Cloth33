# Cloth33 

Flatiron Software Engineering Bootcamp Module 3  Final Project

Cloth33 is a minimalist closet organization application based on the Project333 Challenge. The project is based on only wearing 33 items of clothing for 3 months. As a user, you can add up to 33 items of clothing and create outfits from those items. The application uses Ruby on Rails for the backend, and vanilla JavaScript on the frontend. There are no sessions for the scope of this project, so there will not be any sessions, the "user session" will end after a page refresh. 

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. While in the front-end directory, open index.html in the terminal to launch the browser
3. Go to the backend directory and create a Rails server 

```bash
rails s
```
